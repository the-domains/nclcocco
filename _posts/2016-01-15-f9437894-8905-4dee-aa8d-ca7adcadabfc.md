**Hawaii: an unforgettable journey!**

Back in July 2014, my two best friends and I decided to go big and fly to the Hawaii for a 2 weeks trips touching Hawaii Island (better known as Big Island), Kauai and Oahu.

Thinking about it now, it was by far one of the most amazing trips we have ever done.

I will try to reminisce it telling you a story full of pictures I took there, hoping you can feel at least some of the emotions I felt visiting those amazing places!

So, after 24 hours flight, we arrived to Kona, in the eastern coast of the Hawaii Island.

We started exploring the coast nearby Kona and the fist place we visited was the _Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park_:

Beside these amazing landscape shots, I also had the opportunity to shoot some black and white, more artistic pictures:
